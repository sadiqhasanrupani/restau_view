## 💡 Project Idea: **"EDA on Restaurant Reviews from Google Maps or Zomato"**

---

### 🔍 Scenario (Real-Life Use Case)

Imagine you’re hired as a **Data Analyst at a Food Delivery Startup** (like Zomato, Swiggy, or UberEats). Your task is to analyze **restaurant reviews** in your city to:

- Understand **customer satisfaction**
- Identify **top-performing vs low-rated restaurants**
- Highlight common **complaints or praises**
- Help improve restaurant onboarding and promotion strategy

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Plan

---

#### 1. **Data Collection (from scratch)**

**Option A: Web Scraping (Real Challenge)**

- Target platforms:
  - Google Maps (using `selenium` or `playwright`)
  - Zomato (HTML scraping with `BeautifulSoup`)
- Scrape:
  - Restaurant Name
  - Rating
  - Review Text
  - Reviewer Name & Date
  - Location
  - Cuisine / Tags (optional)

✅ Tools: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `pandas`

---

#### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

- Clean review texts (remove emojis, HTML, stopwords)
- Convert ratings to numeric
- Parse review dates
- Handle missing or duplicate reviews
- Optional: Translate if multilingual

✅ Libraries: `re`, `nltk`, `pandas`, `langdetect`

---

#### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

- 📊 Distribution of ratings (bar plot, pie chart)
- ⏳ Trends over time — are ratings improving or falling?
- 📍 Best/worst restaurants by area or cuisine
- 🧾 Frequent terms in negative reviews (word cloud, bar chart)
- 😊 Sentiment analysis (optional)

---

#### 4. **Insights & Storytelling**

Turn your analysis into insights like:

- "50% of 1-star reviews mention 'late delivery'"
- "Cafés in Koramangala have an average rating of 4.5 vs 3.8 in BTM"
- "Top 5 keywords associated with 5-star reviews: 'ambience', 'service', 'taste', 'quick', 'friendly'"
